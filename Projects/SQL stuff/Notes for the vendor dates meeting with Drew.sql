Confirm what each parameter is, ask the easiest way to find the asdix for a specific date

It appears at first glance to me the asdix is a unique ID for each individual date for each product
CmpltDate is probably the date we're changing it to?
UserId the person thats changing the date?
ModificationDate the day you made the change?

I was using DAL_Testing_GetConsoleDates for finding all the dates from a console number, 
but there isn't an asdix attached to the return of that function, what are your thoughts on getting the asdix from a console number?

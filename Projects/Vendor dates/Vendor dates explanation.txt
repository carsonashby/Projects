This project takes a spreadsheet from a tablet vendor compares it to what we currently have in the system and then writes to our database with whats new.

For more specifics, we read the vendor xlsx file with pandas, connect to our sql database using pyodbc and then move on to comparison.
We check if the date in the database is the same as on the file, if so we don't need to change anything.
Second, if the database has a corresponding date that's not what we have on the file, we notate it but don't change anything so someone can investigate further.
Finally, if the database doesn't have a corresponding date, we make sure we have a tracking number and then we update the database with our date from the file.
